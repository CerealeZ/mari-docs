# Welcome to Mari Docs, a Bruno Parser.

## Why Bruno?

It is one of my favorite programs for making HTTP requests. Its simplicity, its off-line mode and its integration with Git make it one of my favorites for
working in a team and creating documentation. However, despite being a great software, it lacks some features that I want,
such as generating non-OpenAPI HTML documentation. With this application, I am able to browse generated collections without installing Bruno.

My main goal was to make it a CI/CD tool so that every time a release is published, it generates HTML. However, the Bruno CLI does not yet support the generation of collections (as the program does). When I am able to do so, I will take another look at it. For now, it only generates a view of the collection in a nicer form.

You can use it for a preview of a Bruno collection.

## Why Mari Docs?

The choice of the name was a personal one. Mari is a name that conveys calm, tranquility and peace to me. Creating software that conveys that to both users and developers makes me feel that I am transmitting those good energies to others. Development should be something pleasant and satisfying.
